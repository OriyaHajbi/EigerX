// I started with left join because regular join doesnt show values of 0,
// than i compared the DEPARTMENT ID and EMPLOYEE DEPT_ID
// after this i grouped by DEPARTMENT.ID to count all the fields,
// and finally i just sorted the result with desc and asc


select DEPARTMENT.NAME, count(EMPLOYEE.ID)
from DEPARTMENT 
left join EMPLOYEE
on EMPLOYEE.DEPT_ID = DEPARTMENT.ID
group by DEPARTMENT.NAME
order by count(EMPLOYEE.ID) desc, DEPARTMENT.NAME asc
